In response to the challenges posed by digital distractions in contemporary education, this study introduces a scalable web application designed to revolutionize the learning experience. Traditional learning methods, reliant on note-taking and memorization, often struggle to captivate students in an era of abundant internet-based diversions. The proposed solution addresses this issue by incorporating gamification principles, offering a reward system and feedback analysis to boost engagement and motivation. Beyond typical Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) generation, the application encompasses features such as text summarization, notes handling, login/signup functionality, lecture transcription, and efficient data storage. By providing a multifaceted approach to learning enhancement, the web application seeks to create a conducive environment for students who grapple with distractions, all while building a scalable application on Cloud and incorporating MLOPs features
